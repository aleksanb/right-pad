[Intro: Choir]
All of the rights, rights, all of the rights

[Hook: Rihanna]
Turn up the right in here, baby
Extra right, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the right in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to pad everything
Want you to pad all of the rights

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something gauche, can't forget,
Left-pad gone, ecosystem dead.
I took it down, i broke the net,
All repos down, with fractured @HEADs.
EU bout, the rights forgotten,
leave these niggas repos down and rottin,
To my suprise, a left-pad replacing me,
I took those two-bit coders to that phoenix university.

[Pre-Hook: Kanye West]
(Pad to the right)
Left-pad
Right-pad
Launch-pad
Note-pad
D-pad
(Pad to the right, pad to the right)

Bro life, code life, nerd life,
hoe life, every night.
(Pad to the right)

[Hook: Rihanna]
Turn up the right in here, baby
Extra right, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the right in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to pad everything
Want you to pad all of the rights

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Takedown order, respect my brothers
Bitch ass niggas require('right-pad'), hide your body odor.
Public repo, take her offline
Say i'll put her back up, i'll be more supportive.
I made mistakes, i know my rights.
NodeJS sucked me dry, I spent those bytes
She need her daddy, joyent please.
Can't let her semver in that ghetto NodeJS Packaging.
